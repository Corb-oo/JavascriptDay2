                        <h4>Chapter 1088</h4>
                        <p>As flashbacks occur which shows Koby's training with Garp and how he was captured by the Blackbeard Pirates, Garp gives the order for Koby, Helmeppo and Grus as he attacks the giant hand created by Avalo Pizarro, allowing the three to protect the ship, thanks to the skills Koby developed under Garp's tutelage. However, Garp decides to remain behind to protect his comrades. As the narration details these events, elsewhere a fleet of Marines has surrounded Egghead.</p>

                        <h4>Chapter 1089</h4>
                        <p>As the news about the recent events on Hachinosu and Egghead spreads around the world, an earthquake suddenly occurs and causes the entire planet's sea level to rise by a meter. Meanwhile, the fleet of Marines surrounding Egghead, as well as the Five Elders, receive a call about the current situation from York, who—after making a deal with them to recreate the Mother Flame in exchange for becoming a World Noble—is revealed to be a hostage of the Straw Hat Pirates and their allies.

                        <h4>Theories for chapter 1090</h4>
                        <ul style="list-style: none;">
                            <li>The five elders are: Saturn, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Earth (the inner planets in our solar system, this was also already theorised by others), probably I agree with other theories that the flag symbol from the WG is inspired by this constallation, earth in the middle, the rest around

                                The antique weapons are: Uranus, Poseidon (Neptune), Pluton (Pluto) (the outer 3 planets of our solar system, Pluto isn't actually a planet anymore but probably Oda's inspiration came from a time where Pluto was still a dwarf planet (would be 2006 though))
                                
                                Ruffy is the Sun, Imu is the Moon and Blackbeard is the void/vacuum.
                                
                                We know that the Ancient Kingdom has very advanced technology, e.g. robot from the current egghead arc. We also saw via Enel that space pirates exist. I suspect that the ancient kingdom might had also technology in order to travel to other planets/moons.
                                
                                Could it be that Imu is actually coming from the moon, maybe she was a queen and resided on the moon. Joy Boy may be the sun king who lived on earth. We also know that the Lunarians lived on top of the red line.
                                
                                I also think that the 5 elders were maybe emperors on their planets which made a pact with Imu to destroy the ancient kingdom, erase the Lunarians in order to establish the World Government.
                                
                                Interesting thing is that the Skypea people where we know that these stem from the moon, the Lunarians, the five elders all look very human-like. So I assume that on the other planets, not only alien kind of creatures live but also humans. It might be even that during the time of the ancient kingdom that humans already civilized all planets/moons in their OP solar system.
                                
                                Also, a more philosophical note: The moon shines due to sun reflection or the reflection of sunlight on earth which falls again on the moon. Would be cool if the ancient kingdom (maybe dawn kingdom or sun kingdom) was the kingdom that reigned over the whole OP solar system and Imu was actually the queen of Joyboy living on the moon. An event must had destroy the trust of Imu in Joyboy.
                                
                                Ruffy can utilize fire in attacks like red hawk (there are theories how say that ruffy generates due to friction so much heat that his arm ignites, but I see it differently: When Ruffy uses Red Hawk, his arm stretches, then ignites and catches fire and then he rapidly brings his arm back). It would also match with Blackbears ability to nullify DFs since he is representing the vacuum.
                                
                                But this is all speculation, just some random thoughts.</li>
